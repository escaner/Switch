 Switch is an Arduino library to handle switches and buttons while performing
debounce.

 The class keeps track of the last event different from the current state and
when it is stable for a given time, it assumes a change in the switch state.
 Provides either switch state information and flank information.
 A SwitchKp class works with analog keypads that do not support multiple
simultaneous key presses.
