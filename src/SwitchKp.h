 *   Updates the switch internal status with the latest read value, keeping

 *   If a press of a switch is detected while the status reads that a prior
 *  different switch was pressed, it will report a release of the original
 *  switch.
 *   Parameters:
 *   * ReadSwitch: switch for value read in the corresponding pin (LOW: none)
 *   * pEventSwitch: returns the switch for which a press, release or still
 *     pressing has happened. When stable and no switch pressed, it will return
 *     SWITCH_NONE.
 *   Returns: flank produced by this update
 *   * FLANK_FALLING: switch state went from HIGH to LOW
 *   * FLANK_NONE: switch state did not change
 *   * FLANK_RISING: switch state went from LOW to HIGH
